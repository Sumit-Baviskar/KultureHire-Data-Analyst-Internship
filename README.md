# **üîÑ Project Workflow (Detailed Version) :**

This project was structured around a clearly defined workflow that moved through each phase of the data analytics lifecycle. From identifying the problem to communicating final results, every step was carefully designed to ensure high-quality analysis and actionable insights for stakeholders. Here's an in-depth breakdown of each stage:



## üß© **1. Problem Statement Documentation :**

The project began by identifying and defining the core problem the analysis aimed to solve:  
> **‚ÄúWhat are the career expectations, job preferences, and motivations of Gen-Z individuals entering the workforce?‚Äù**

Given the evolving nature of work and the unique values of Generation Z, this project set out to uncover insights that could assist hiring managers, recruiters, and organizational leaders in better aligning their workplace culture and recruitment strategies with Gen-Z priorities.

To ensure clarity and alignment, a brief was prepared in collaboration with mentors at **KultureHire**. This document laid out the **key business questions**, such as:
- What industries or job roles does Gen-Z find most appealing?
- What work formats (remote, hybrid, on-site) do they prefer, and why?
- How do salary expectations vary by gender, education level, and region?
- What non-monetary values influence their job decisions (flexibility, mental health support, purpose, etc.)?



## üì• **2. Data Collection :**

To gather relevant data, I designed a comprehensive survey using **Google Forms** that targeted Gen-Z respondents from diverse academic and geographical backgrounds. The form included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions to capture:
- Preferred career fields and job roles  
- Work style preferences (remote vs. on-site)  
- Expected salary range  
- Motivating workplace values (e.g., work-life balance, mental health, social impact)  
- Demographic data (age, gender, education, location)

The form was distributed through educational networks, social media platforms, and peer sharing.

üîó **Google Form Link :** - [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNX5VW8Bu-noqdxQOD_WxTIK_YO6sr8WvShI8nXMS0XXx7tg/viewform?usp=dialog] 

This ensured a broad and representative dataset of Gen-Z opinions and expectations.


## üßπ **3. Data Cleaning & Standardization (Excel):**

Before analyzing the Career_Aspirations dataset, it‚Äôs essential to clean and prepare the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involves using Excel tools like Text to Columns, Find & Replace, IF formulas, and data type formatting to standardize the dataset and remove inconsistencies. A clean dataset ensures reliable insights and effective SQL querying.


#### ‚úÖ 1. **Text to Columns**
- Use **Text to Columns** to separate values if they‚Äôre combined (e.g., Date and Time in the same cell).

- Go to:  
  **Data ‚Üí Text to Columns ‚Üí Delimited (e.g., comma, tab) ‚Üí Finish**
- Example: Split combined columns like `Date/Time` into separate `Date` and `Time` fields.

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Find & Replace**

- Used to clean inconsistent entries, fix typos, or remove unwanted characters (like extra spaces or special characters).


- Go to:  
  **Home ‚Üí Find & Select ‚Üí Replace**
- Example:
  - Replace `self-sponser` with `self-sponsor`
  - Replace `Closet Carrer to Aspirational Job` with `Closest Career to Aspirational Job`

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. **IF Statements**
- Use `IF()` formulas to create logical flags or fix inconsistent data.
- Example:
  ```excel
  =IF(A2="Not Mentioned", "Unknown", A2)
  ```
  - Replace "Not Mentioned" values with "Unknown" or blanks.
  - Identify low salaries:
    ```excel
    =IF(B2<20000, "Low", "Acceptable")
    ```

---

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Changing Data Types**
- Ensure correct formats:
  - **Date Columns** ‚Üí Format as `Date`
  - **Salary Columns** ‚Üí Remove symbols like `k`, `>`, and convert ranges like `31k to 40k` to numeric midpoints (e.g., `35,000`)
    - Use helper columns and formulas:
      ```excel
      =MID(A2,1,FIND("k",A2)-1)*1000
      ```
      or manually input average values.
  - **Yes/Maybe/No** columns ‚Üí Convert to standardized ENUM-like formats if needed.

---

#### ‚úÖ 5. **Trimming Extra Spaces**
- Use `TRIM()` to clean up entries:
  ```excel
  =TRIM(A2)
  ```

---

#### ‚úÖ 6. **Standardizing Values**
- Ensure consistent casing (e.g., "Hybrid" vs "hybrid")
- Use `PROPER()` to make values consistently capitalized:
  ```excel
  =PROPER(A2)
  ```

---

#### ‚úÖ 7. **Remove Duplicates**
- Use **Data ‚Üí Remove Duplicates** to ensure unique responses, especially if email IDs are present.



## üîç **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Excel:**
